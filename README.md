# Tutorial


## TODO/Planning
The tutorial should essentially be similar to Svelte/Kit one but as interactive as possible,
and as ludic as possible, making it as fun and accessible as possible for many levels of comprehension.


### Chapters
The chapters and setps should be interactive and simulate machines, applications and
etc in realtime
Also should show interfaces that are distinct for each part of them, making clear when
something is local, remote, etc

Also show essential statistics like ping, requests/responses counts, a graph(or more, grahps good),
etc


### Compilers
Load compilers(in WASM i think?) that allow for compilation of code of the tutorial in
realtime

Display a page warning the progress of the download while it happens, speed, ETA, etc.
